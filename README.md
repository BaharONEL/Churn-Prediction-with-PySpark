# Churn-Prediction-with-PySpark
## Business Problem
It is expected to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company.
## Dataset Story
It consists of 10000 observations and 12 variables.
The independent variables contain information about customers.
The dependent variable represents the customer abandonment status.
## Variables
